    "In the project for the last lesson, you created routes that would generate fractals as PNG images.  In that case, what you were asked to do was a simiplification of the structure of the library.  Specifically, what the library really generates are **NumPy arrays** that represent fractals; the visualization is an optional secondary step.  You were not aked to do that to skip the need for transmitting data in formats other than as a PNG image.\n",

    "However, a microservice architecture should not do everything at one route.  Rendering is separate from generation, and moreover, you'd like to be able to work with the numeric arrays directly at times.  One note, however, is that rendering each single complex point on a separate node/service is going to be hugely inefficient.  The appropriate level of granularity is the \"canvas\" (i.e. 2-D integer array of points that is potentially visualized)."
